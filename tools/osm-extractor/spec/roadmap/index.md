# OSM Extractor Roadmap

0.1.x = Foundation and schema-safe validation CLI  
0.2.x = OSM ingestion and normalization (see `0.2.0.md`)  
0.3.x = Full pack build with boundary-aware QA gates (see `0.3.0.md`)  
0.4.x = Config-driven single-resort pipeline (see `0.4.0.md`)  
1.0.0 = Stable multi-resort extraction pipeline (see `1.0.0.md`)
1.1.x = Structured audit logs for operations and troubleshooting (see `1.1.0.md`)
1.2.x = Deterministic provenance artifacts for resort and fleet outputs (see `1.2.0.md`)
1.3.x = Machine-readable pack validation with entity references (see `1.3.0.md`)
1.4.x = Area-config bbox filtering for scoped resort extraction (see `1.4.0.md`)
1.5.x = Deterministic timestamp controls for reproducible outputs (see `1.5.0.md`)
1.6.x = Machine-readable pack summary output for review automation (see `1.6.0.md`)
1.7.x = Machine-readable extraction result output for automation (see `1.7.0.md`)
1.8.x = Machine-readable ingest/build result output for CLI parity (see `1.8.0.md`)
1.9.x = Machine-readable CLI error envelopes for automation-safe failures (see `1.9.0.md`)
2.0.x = CLI-first resort acquisition with staged boundary/lifts/runs sync (see `2.0.0.md`)
