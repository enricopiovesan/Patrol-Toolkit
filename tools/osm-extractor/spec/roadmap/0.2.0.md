# OSM Extractor Roadmap 0.2.0

## Objective
Introduce local OSM ingestion and deterministic normalization as the base for pack generation.

## Capabilities
- `ingest-osm` CLI command for local OSM JSON input.
- Normalized output with:
  - resort identity,
  - resort boundary polygon,
  - lift lines with tower sequence,
  - downhill run centerlines.
- Provenance metadata (`sha256`, source filename, OSM base timestamp).

## Acceptance Criteria
1. CLI ingests local OSM JSON without network access.
2. Boundary extraction supports winter-sports multipolygon relations and fallback boundary ways.
3. Output is deterministic for same input and options.
4. Tests cover runs/lifts/boundary extraction and deterministic output behavior.
