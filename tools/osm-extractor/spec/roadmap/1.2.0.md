# OSM Extractor Roadmap 1.2.0

## Objective
Strengthen provenance traceability by emitting deterministic provenance artifacts for resort and fleet extraction outputs.

## Capabilities
- Resort pipeline writes `provenance.json` (configurable filename) with:
  - source metadata (input, OSM base timestamp, source hash),
  - generated artifact paths,
  - SHA-256 checksums for normalized source, pack, and report.
- Fleet pipeline writes `fleet-provenance.json` (configurable path) with:
  - manifest checksum,
  - per-resort provenance references and artifact checksums.
- CLI output includes provenance artifact paths for:
  - `extract-resort`,
  - `extract-fleet`.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Resort extraction emits a provenance file every successful run.
2. Fleet extraction emits a provenance file tied to the generated manifest.
3. Provenance includes deterministic checksums for produced artifacts.
4. Tests verify provenance artifact generation and schema version values.
