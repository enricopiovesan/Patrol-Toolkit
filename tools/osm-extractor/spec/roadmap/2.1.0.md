# OSM Extractor Roadmap 2.1.0

## Objective
Add an operator-first interactive `menu` workflow with immutable resort version storage and stable status metrics.

## Capabilities
- New CLI entry command: `menu`.
- Menu options:
  - select known resort (latest version),
  - search/select new resort with mandatory prompts (`name`, `countryCode`, `town`),
  - boundary detect/set,
  - sync lifts,
  - sync runs,
  - sync status.
- Resort storage root: `resorts/`.
- Resort directory naming: `CC_Town_Resort_Name` (ASCII-normalized).
- Immutable per-resort version folders: `v1`, `v2`, ... with no in-place overwrite.
- Stable per-version metrics file: `status.json`.
- Existing non-interactive command mode remains available for developer automation.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. `menu` mode is fully functional without breaking existing command mode.
2. Search flow blocks execution until required prompts are provided (`name`, `countryCode`, `town`).
3. Resort data is stored under deterministic resort directories with immutable version folders.
4. Every created version contains `status.json` matching a documented stable contract.
5. Known resort listing defaults to latest version only.
6. `status.json` includes a manual validation flag indicating whether the version has been manually tested/validated.
