# OSM Extractor Roadmap 0.1.0

## Objective
Establish a standalone extractor CLI with validated pack read/summary capabilities and isolated product specs.

## Capabilities
- Separate extractor workspace.
- `validate-pack` command.
- `summarize-pack` command.
- Dedicated extractor specs (vision/personas/use-cases/nfr/roadmap).

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Extractor CLI builds and tests independently.
2. Valid pack fixture passes `validate-pack` logic.
3. Invalid pack fixture fails with explicit errors.
4. Specs exist under extractor-specific path, separate from app specs.
