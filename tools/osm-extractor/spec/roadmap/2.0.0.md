# OSM Extractor Roadmap 2.0.0

## Objective
Introduce a CLI-first resort acquisition flow that discovers resorts, selects validated boundaries, and syncs lifts/runs in staged, resumable steps.

## Capabilities
- `resort search` flow using resort name + country with ranked candidate output.
- `resort select` flow that persists the selected resort identity from candidate results.
- Staged acquisition model with explicit layers:
  - boundary
  - lifts
  - runs
- Layer sync status tracking to prevent silent partial updates.
- Incremental refresh use case support for updating only changed layers after OSM edits.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Resort discovery and selection specs are deterministic and support ambiguous name resolution.
2. Boundary selection includes validation requirements before downstream layer sync.
3. Lifts/runs sync is defined as independent, repeatable, layer-specific operations.
4. Spec supports update workflows where a patrol maintainer edits OSM data and re-syncs a subset of layers.
