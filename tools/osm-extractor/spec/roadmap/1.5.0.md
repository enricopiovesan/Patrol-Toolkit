# OSM Extractor Roadmap 1.5.0

## Objective
Enforce deterministic timestamps across generated artifacts to satisfy reproducibility requirements in CI and offline workflows.

## Capabilities
- Deterministic `generatedAt` resolution:
  - explicit override (`--generated-at` or config),
  - fallback to source OSM timestamp when available,
  - deterministic epoch fallback when no source timestamp exists.
- Timestamp override support in:
  - `build-pack`,
  - `extract-resort`,
  - `extract-fleet`.
- Deterministic timestamp propagation to:
  - extraction report,
  - resort provenance,
  - fleet manifest,
  - fleet provenance.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Same input/config/tool version can produce stable timestamps.
2. Override timestamp is respected across all generated artifacts.
3. Resort and fleet tests verify deterministic timestamp propagation.
4. Validation fails fast for invalid timestamp format.
