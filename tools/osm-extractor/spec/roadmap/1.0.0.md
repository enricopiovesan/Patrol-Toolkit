# OSM Extractor Roadmap 1.0.0

## Objective
Provide a stable multi-resort extraction pipeline with deterministic batch execution and auditable fleet-level results.

## Capabilities
- `extract-fleet --config <fleet-config.json>` command.
- Fleet config schema validation (`schemaVersion: 1.0.0`).
- Batch orchestration over multiple resort extraction configs.
- Fleet manifest output with:
  - success/failure counters,
  - per-resort status and artifact paths,
  - deterministic processing order.
- Failure policy control:
  - fail-fast by default,
  - optional `continueOnError` to process the full fleet.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Valid fleet config can extract multiple resorts and produce one manifest.
2. Manifest includes per-resort status and summary counters.
3. Default behavior fails fast on first resort failure while still writing a manifest.
4. Tests cover successful multi-resort execution and fail-fast behavior.
