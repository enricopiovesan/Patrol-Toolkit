# OSM Extractor Roadmap 0.3.0

## Objective
Generate a production-ready `pack.json` from normalized OSM data with boundary-aware QA gates.

## Capabilities
- `build-pack` command that converts normalized source into Resort Pack schema `1.0.0`.
- Difficulty normalization into app-supported levels (`green`, `blue`, `black`, `double-black`).
- Deterministic run polygon generation from centerlines.
- Boundary QA gate:
  - fail by default when runs/lifts are outside boundary,
  - explicit override via `--allow-outside-boundary`.
- Structured extraction report output (`report.json`) with gate status and issues.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Valid normalized source can produce a schema-valid `pack.json`.
2. Boundary gate reports `passed`, `failed`, or `skipped` states.
3. Boundary violations block output unless explicit override is used.
4. Tests cover successful build path and boundary failure path.
