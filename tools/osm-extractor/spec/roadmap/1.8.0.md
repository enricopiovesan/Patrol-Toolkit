# OSM Extractor Roadmap 1.8.0

## Objective
Complete machine-readable CLI parity by adding JSON output mode to ingestion and pack build commands.

## Capabilities
- `ingest-osm --json` output mode.
- `build-pack --json` output mode.
- Structured JSON payloads include:
  - ingestion counts and boundary presence,
  - build counts, schema version, boundary gate status, and artifact paths.
- Existing human-readable output remains unchanged when `--json` is omitted.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Ingestion JSON mode returns deterministic structured summary fields.
2. Build JSON mode returns deterministic structured summary fields.
3. Existing text outputs remain backward compatible.
4. Tests cover formatter contracts for ingest/build JSON payloads.
