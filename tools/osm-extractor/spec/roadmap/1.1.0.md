# OSM Extractor Roadmap 1.1.0

## Objective
Provide structured processing logs for audit and troubleshooting across resort and fleet extraction pipelines.

## Capabilities
- Optional `--log-file <audit.jsonl>` for:
  - `extract-resort`,
  - `extract-fleet`.
- JSONL audit events with:
  - ISO timestamp,
  - level (`info`/`error`),
  - event name,
  - structured context payload.
- Coverage for lifecycle events:
  - pipeline start/end,
  - ingest/build stage boundaries,
  - validation failures,
  - fleet resort start/success/failure,
  - manifest write.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Resort extraction writes stage-level audit events when log file is provided.
2. Fleet extraction writes fleet-level and per-resort audit events when log file is provided.
3. Failures are recorded as `error` events with actionable context.
4. Tests verify log structure and event presence.
