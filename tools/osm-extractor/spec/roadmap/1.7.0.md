# OSM Extractor Roadmap 1.7.0

## Objective
Expose machine-readable extraction results for resort and fleet commands to simplify CI/CD orchestration.

## Capabilities
- `extract-resort --json` output mode.
- `extract-fleet --json` output mode.
- Structured JSON payloads include:
  - generated timestamp,
  - high-level counts/status,
  - artifact paths,
  - critical checksums for resort extraction.
- Existing human-readable command output remains unchanged.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Resort extraction JSON includes counts, boundary gate, artifact paths, and checksums.
2. Fleet extraction JSON includes totals and key artifact paths.
3. Existing text output remains backward compatible when `--json` is not set.
4. Tests cover JSON payload formatter shape and deterministic fields.
