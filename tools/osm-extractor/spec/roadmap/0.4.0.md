# OSM Extractor Roadmap 0.4.0

## Objective
Deliver a config-driven single-resort extraction flow that turns local OSM input into ready-to-import artifacts in one command.

## Capabilities
- `extract-resort --config <config.json>` command.
- Strict config schema validation (`schemaVersion: 0.4.0`).
- End-to-end orchestration:
  - ingest OSM to normalized source,
  - build validated `pack.json`,
  - emit extraction report.
- Deterministic output locations with configurable filenames under one output directory.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Valid config can generate normalized source, pack, and report in one run.
2. Invalid config fails fast with actionable error paths.
3. Pipeline output `pack.json` is schema-valid and re-validated at pipeline end.
4. Tests cover config validation and full pipeline execution.
