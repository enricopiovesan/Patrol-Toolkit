# v0.0.1 Field Trial Runbook

## Goal
Validate Patrol Toolkit during a real patrol day and confirm operational usefulness for live radio communication.

## Preconditions
- Device has Patrol Toolkit installed as PWA.
- App has been opened at least once with connectivity.
- A valid Resort Pack has been imported and set active.
- Device location permission is granted.
- Device battery > 50% before shift start.

## Trial Scope
- Use Patrol Toolkit for location phrasing on active terrain.
- Record at least 5 phrase-generation attempts during normal operations.
- Record at least 1 live radio call where generated phrase is used.

## Step-by-Step Procedure
1. Start-of-shift offline check.
- Put device in airplane mode.
- Open app and confirm map loads.
- Confirm active Resort Pack is shown.
- Generate and copy one phrase to verify controls and clipboard.

2. During-shift operational checks.
- At each checkpoint, capture:
  - timestamp,
  - terrain context,
  - generated phrase,
  - phrase actually spoken on radio,
  - whether edits were needed.
- Record generation latency by counting from tap on `Generate Phrase` to phrase display.
- Mark any failure mode immediately (no GPS lock, incorrect run, missing tower, copy failure).

3. Live radio validation.
- Use generated phrase for at least one live call.
- Log whether phrase reduced back-and-forth clarifications on channel.

4. End-of-shift debrief.
- Summarize reliability, clarity, and confidence impact.
- List top 3 improvements requested by patrol members.

## Pass/Fail Exit Criteria
Pass requires all items:
- App usable offline throughout trial.
- Phrase generation consistently under 2 seconds in field use.
- Run name present when inside run geometry.
- Tower context present when within configured threshold.
- Copy action works on tested device.
- At least one successful live radio use logged.
- Feedback captured from patrol members.

## Incident Logging Format
Use one line per attempt:

`<timestamp> | <location context> | generated="..." | spoken="..." | latency_ms=<n> | outcome=<ok|edited|failed> | notes="..."`
